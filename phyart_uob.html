									<h3 class="major">Logo</h3>
									<p>The logo is simply the name of the project in a bold font to esnure readability. However, there's a nod to the hydrogen atom in place of the "@" symbol. The hydrogen atom is synonymous with physics and I think it's a good addition to give the logo a bit of spice, without overcomplicating it.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Website</h3>
									<h4 class="major">The Brief</h4>
									<p>The website was created to quickly provide a location to document the outreach and engagement activities performed between physicists at University of Birmingham and local artists, to be used as a piece of evidence in the researcher excellence framework (REF).</p>

									<p>Under the guidance of academics involved in the project, as well as the project's curator, on the website needs, I was asked to produce a website that showcased the collaborations established and events run (to-date) with a clean and modern design.</p>


									<h4 class="major">Platform</h4>
									<p>The squarespace platform was used mainly due to the speed in which a functional website can be created. It also gives the benefit of easier editing capabilities for whoever was to take over the responsibility of maintaining the website after I left. It does, of course, come with a higher cost, but this</p>


									<h4 class="major">The Outcome</h4>
									<p>I wanted the website to give the user the experience of being in a gallery or museum, hence the white background and focus on the images and descriptive content throughout the website. Different design concepts were laid out using several different squarespace styles, until this was agreed upon by the people involved in the project.</p>
									<p>I really like the gallery view on the collaborations pages, and the consistency between the different pages - be it a collaborations, event, or interview - which focuses the attention on the content. The image carousels can be heavy on the browser, and affect the website's performance, but it was accepted to provide the consistent feel throughout.</p>
									<p>Please visit the <a href=https://www.phyartuob.co.uk/>PHYART@UoB website</a> to see it all in action!</p>
